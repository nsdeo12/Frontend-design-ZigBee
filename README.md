Abstract: As the Internet of Things wave is around the
corner extending the internet to the real world
embracing everyday objects, the communication
protocols need to be revisited. Personal area networks
(PAN) will revolutionize the way we live. Lightweight
protocols like Bluetooth and ZigBee will be heavily
sought for and the hardware to support them, such as
amplifiers that will work hand in hand with these
protocols, must be redesigned. In this paper, we propose
a novel technique for impedance matching in the design
of Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) using lumped passive
components which reduces the overall chip area. In
addition, we discuss the insights gained by reducing the
mathematical overhead of the LNA design process in
approximation of parasitic capacitances. The frequency
band is 2-2.4 GHz. The noise figure is found to be less
than 3dB.
